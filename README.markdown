# Breakout

To help me learn how to use C++ and SDL I'm programming my own version of the
classic arcade game Breakout.

## Dependencies

* SDL
* SDL_image
* SDL_ttf

## Build

Run 'make' from the project root directory. This will create a 'breakout' binary.

## Thanks

* [LazyFoo](http://www.lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/) - for the tutorials and some
  of the utility functions I use.
